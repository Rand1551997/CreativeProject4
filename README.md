As with other creative projects, you can build what you want, and you can build on your own previous creative projects, as long as you show sufficient originality and functionality.

Originality
It should not be too similar to the website you built for previous labs or activities. You must create your own original work. What you want to avoid is copying an existing project and changing only the style type of data, for example changing a grocery store to a hardware store. You should be writing substantial code on your own so that you can gain additional mastery of the material. You can ask your TA for guidance on what constitutes an original work before coding.

Functionality
The idea for this project is to combine everything you have learned so far into a single project. This should include:

- The front end uses the Vue CLI and Vue Router.
- The back end uses Node, Express, and Mongo.
- The site allows users to create, edit, and delete data on the site.
- The site has user authentication (registration and login) based on usernames and passwords, with actions restricted based on whether the suer is logged in.
- The site stores data specific to each user.
- The front end uses a REST API to talk to the back end. 
- The REST API uses authentication to prevent unauthorized users from making changes to the database.
- The REST API supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting items in the database 
- The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository and includes the number of hours you spent on the project. The GitHub repository should be in your personal account.
Your Creative Project #4 may meet many of these requirements. You are welcome (and encouraged) to use your Creative Project #4 and add user authentication, data specific to each user, and anything else required to meet the above functional requirements.

We are asking you to report the number of hour spent only to gauge the difficulty of the assignment. Include only the hours on this project, not counting hours from previous creative projects. It will not affect your grading.

Pair Programming
You are welcome to work alone or in a group of two on this project.  if you work as a pair, you need to follow the pair programming guidelines in the syllabus, contribute equally, and turn in the same URL.  

Submission
On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server. 
Be sure the footer of your site includes the number of hours you spent on the project.
Rubric for Grading
We will use the rubric below.
